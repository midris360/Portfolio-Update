              <h4>Mohammed Idris</h4>
              <p>I go by my middle name, Katzeem, I am from Newark, NJ where I currently reside. I am a Software Engineer and what makes me special is that this is something that I love to do, day in and day out, even if I'm not working professional, I will do the same as a hobby.</p>
              <p>Being able to do Thinkful's Engineering Flex cohort as really help push me to where I need to be professionally and even mentally because if I was to do self-study, I'd probably be procrastinating and getting distracted.</p>

              <img src="https://static.toiimg.com/photo/msid-70661134/70661134.jpg?761205" alt="hobbies1" class="rounded" />

          <div class="item-double">
            <p>In my professional career, I was in technical support, then moved into Data Center Tech and now becoming a Software Engineer which I always wanted to do being the reason I chose Computer Science major. I always wanted to code since the Myspace days where I can change up thelook of the page manually. Also, working with a team would be major for me because there is a lot to learn from other great programmers to create wonderful projects together and have fun doing it.</p>

            <p>List of services I can provide range from: </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Music apps</li>
              <li>Video game apps</li>
              <li>Websites</li>
              <li>GPS apps</li>
            </ul>

            <p>When I'm not coding, what I like to do for fun is play Basketball, create music, playing video games, and stay up on the latest technology. My first love was Basketball because I played basketball in elementary school all the through College and had dreams of playing in the NBA but had to stop because of physical reasons. I still have those dreams though, it may come true......maybe lol.</p>
